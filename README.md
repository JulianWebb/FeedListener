# FeedListener

Takes Feeds (currently only RSS), polls them at set intervals, and then push new items to a Discord Webhook

Created for personal usage as I follow way too many webcomics and find myself overly checking them for updates. With this project, I can have the updates come to me on a platform I already use.

Plans for the future include:
* Include support for other feed types
* Include user interaction on Discord (e.g. adding feeds)
* Keep track of the feeds between restarts
* Check more than the latest feed item
